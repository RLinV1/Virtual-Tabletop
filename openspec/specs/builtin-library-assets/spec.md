# builtin-library-assets Specification

## Purpose
Gives every GM a ready-to-use set of maps and token art that ship with the app, so the library and room pickers are useful before anything has been uploaded, without anyone being able to remove the defaults for others.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Built-in assets in every library
The asset library SHALL include a fixed catalog of maps and token art that ships with the app. It SHALL be visible to every GM, including one who has uploaded nothing. It SHALL be listed separately from the GM's own assets, under "Included with the app", and filtered by the same tab and search.

#### Scenario: New GM sees the defaults
- **WHEN** a GM with an empty library opens the asset library
- **THEN** the Maps tab lists The Broken Span, Hollowfrost Keep and Temple of the Green Sun under "Included with the app", and the Tokens tab lists the five included portraits

#### Scenario: Search covers built-ins
- **WHEN** the GM searches "frost" on the Maps tab
- **THEN** Hollowfrost Keep is listed and the other built-in maps are not

### Requirement: Built-ins are read-only
Built-in assets SHALL NOT offer rename or delete. No action by one GM SHALL change the built-ins another GM sees.

#### Scenario: No management actions
- **WHEN** the GM views a built-in card
- **THEN** it shows the image, name and size, and no Rename or Delete control

### Requirement: Place a built-in in a room
The room's "From library" pickers for maps and token images SHALL list the GM's own assets first, then the built-ins. Placing a built-in map SHALL set the room's map at that map's own size and apply that map's own saved grid, including its cell size and offset. Choosing a built-in token image SHALL use it for the new token. The room SHALL record the image URL without a library asset id.

#### Scenario: Built-in map
- **WHEN** the GM picks Hollowfrost Keep from "From library"
- **THEN** the room shows that map at 3269×1882 with a 70 px grid offset 47 px right and 46 px down, and no "Save grid to library" control is offered for it

#### Scenario: Built-in token portrait
- **WHEN** the GM adds a token using a built-in portrait
- **THEN** the token is drawn with that portrait, and the library usage index records nothing for it

### Requirement: Built-in maps are top-down battle maps with their own grid
Every built-in map SHALL be drawn from directly overhead, with no visible wall or building sides, and SHALL contain no creatures, people or animals, including statues shaped like them. Each built-in map SHALL carry its own grid, measured from its art, so that its grid lines roughly follow the drawn floor tiles and walls across the whole map. A built-in map SHALL be at least 2600 px wide, so it is usable as a table map at about 70 px per square.

#### Scenario: Grid follows the art
- **WHEN** a built-in map's saved grid is drawn over it
- **THEN** grid lines fall along the drawn paving and walls, and no line is more than about half a square from the tile edge it should follow anywhere on the map

#### Scenario: Each map has its own grid
- **WHEN** the built-in catalogue is read
- **THEN** The Broken Span has a 69.4 px grid offset (10, 31), Hollowfrost Keep a 70 px grid offset (47, 46), and Temple of the Green Sun a 70 px grid offset (21, 36), each with its own image size
