# Tasks

## 1. Contract and detector

- [x] 1.1 Record ADR and remove confidence from shared contracts/UI; verify schema tests and typecheck.
- [x] 1.2 Port reviewed preprocessing, LSD and fitter, pin runtime; verify geometry and image-boundary Python tests.
- [x] 1.3 Implement disposable-child supervisor, busy admission and deadlines; verify process timeout/admission tests.

## 2. Persistence and scheduling

- [x] 2.1 Add source/configuration identity and terminal-error migration to both stores; verify cache, CAS, invalidation, recovery and deletion tests including Postgres restart.
- [x] 2.2 Update both upload paths with source identity and decoded dimensions; verify tokens, EXIF, oversized images and authorization integration tests.
- [x] 2.3 Bound local/BullMQ execution and retries, handle busy without attempt consumption; verify duplicate-job, overflow and stale-completion tests.

## 3. Editor behavior

- [x] 3.1 Add per-session manual-interaction latch and once-only automatic prefilling; verify delayed first-anchor/typing, saved-grid, discard, save, switch and dismissal browser workflows.
- [x] 3.2 Resolve library cache on selection, require setup before unconfigured placement, stop absent/denied polling; verify library placement and unchanged invocation counts in browser/server checks.

## 4. Verification and performance

- [x] 4.1 Capture unoptimized application baseline, replay saved segments to 1e-6 px and run all 27 pipelines; document any period/phase differences.
- [x] 4.2 Measure three shuffled passes before/after optimizations, preserving parity; report components, processing, queue waiting, browser availability, throughput and process memory separately; render review overlays outside timing.
- [x] 4.3 Verify configurable 2 GiB Compose ceiling and one active wall job alongside grid work; record container memory and full-stack acceptance evidence when Docker is available.

  Docker acceptance passed on 2026-10-26 in an isolated Compose project. All 27 maps retained geometry within 1e-6 px, with one active grid job and one active wall job. The enforced grid limit was 2 GiB; grid/wall cgroup peaks were 644,042,752 / 1,368,784,896 bytes with zero OOM events. A real database restart reused all 27 map results and one no_grid result with zero new detector invocations. Full-stack uploads, S3 artwork preservation, Python/npm suites and all 18 browser cases passed. See `docs/QA-classical-grid.md` and `docs/classical-grid-evidence.json`.
- [x] 4.4 Run lint, typecheck, complete tests, Python wall/grid suites, build and relevant Playwright checks; deliver branch and verification report without supplied maps, merge or deployment.

## 5. Wait before revealing setup

- [x] 5.1 Add shared editor-session preparation and bounded status requests; reveal fitted geometry atomically, preserve units/style, and latch every manual fallback or skip.
- [x] 5.2 Integrate the waiting step into library and room setup, including uploads and pending selections/reopening; coordinate one poller per session, accessible dismissal/status/focus, and configured/UVTT bypasses.
- [x] 5.3 Verify transitions, first visible geometry, all skips and races, stale/unmounted sessions, failures/timeouts and waits beyond 15 seconds; retain private drafts and explicit saving/placement.
- [x] 5.4 Update the proposal, design, delta specs and ADR 0044; run lint, typecheck, full application tests, build, all configured grid/UVTT browsers and isolated Docker fitting/skip checks, and record results without merging or deploying.

  Waiting-step verification passed: 2,168 application tests (one existing environment-dependent skip), all 49 Python regressions, 24 grid and six UVTT browser cases across every configured profile, plus 12 repeated fitting/skip cases on the final race-guard build. Real Docker fitting revealed candidate geometry on the first editable frame; X preserved manual typing after server completion, cached reopening reused the estimate, and room placement stayed explicit. The isolated QA stack was stopped without changing the user's stack or original checkout. See `docs/QA-grid-preparation.md` and `/private/tmp/vtt-grid-preparation-qa/` for evidence.
