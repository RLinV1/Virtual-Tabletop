## Purpose

Lets the GM turn walls into doors and windows that open, close and lock, so movement through a doorway follows the portal's state, and players see and use the portals in front of them (FR-GM-18, FR-GM-09).

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The GM designates walls as portals
The GM SHALL be able to make any wall a door or a window with a state of open, closed or locked, to change an existing portal's kind or state, and to turn a portal back into a plain wall. Players SHALL NOT be able to do any of these. A designation that changes nothing SHALL be refused. Each change SHALL be one undoable action.

#### Scenario: Mark a doorway
- **WHEN** the GM picks Door and Closed in the map editor's Door / window tool, clicks an existing wall, and saves the editor's changes
- **THEN** that wall becomes a closed door, and the activity log reads "made a wall a closed door"

#### Scenario: Nothing changes before Save
- **WHEN** the GM marks a wall as a door in the map editor but has not saved
- **THEN** the room's walls are unchanged and players see no door

#### Scenario: A new wall drawn as a door
- **WHEN** the GM draws a wall in the map editor, marks it as a door, and saves
- **THEN** the room gains that wall already a door, in one undoable action

#### Scenario: A player cannot designate portals
- **WHEN** a player sends `portal.set`
- **THEN** the server refuses it as forbidden and nothing changes

#### Scenario: Unknown wall
- **WHEN** the GM sends `portal.set` for a wall id that does not exist
- **THEN** the server refuses it as not found

### Requirement: Portal state controls movement
A closed or locked portal SHALL block tokens exactly as a wall does: no token's footprint may cross it, and a player may not move a token straight through it. An open portal SHALL NOT block tokens.

#### Scenario: Walk through an open door
- **WHEN** a player moves their token straight through an open door
- **THEN** the move is accepted

#### Scenario: A closed door is in the way
- **WHEN** a player moves their token straight through a closed door
- **THEN** the server refuses it with "A wall is in the way."

#### Scenario: Locked blocks like closed
- **WHEN** a player moves their token straight through a locked window
- **THEN** the server refuses it with "A wall is in the way."

### Requirement: Who may change a portal's state
The GM SHALL be able to set any portal to any state. A player SHALL be able to open a closed portal and close an open one, but only one they can see. A player SHALL NOT be able to lock a portal, or to unlock or open a locked one. Setting a portal to the state it already has SHALL be refused. A plain wall, a missing wall and a portal the player cannot see SHALL all be refused with the same answer.

#### Scenario: A player opens a door
- **WHEN** a player clicks a closed door they can see
- **THEN** the door opens for everyone, and the GM's activity log reads "opened a door"

#### Scenario: A player meets a locked door
- **WHEN** a player sends `portal.setState` to open a locked door
- **THEN** the server refuses it with "That door is locked." and the door stays locked

#### Scenario: A player cannot lock
- **WHEN** a player sends `portal.setState` with state `locked`
- **THEN** the server refuses it as forbidden

#### Scenario: A door under fog
- **WHEN** a player sends `portal.setState` for a door whose midpoint is under fog
- **THEN** the server refuses it as not found, the same answer as for a wall id that does not exist

#### Scenario: The GM locks a door
- **WHEN** the GM Shift-clicks a closed door on the board
- **THEN** the door becomes locked, and the activity log reads "locked a door"

### Requirement: Players see the portals in front of them
A player's state SHALL contain every portal wall whose midpoint is outside fog, with its kind and state, and SHALL NOT contain plain walls or portals under fog. When a change reveals or withdraws a portal for a player (a portal added, removed or designated, or fog added or removed), the player SHALL receive a fresh filtered state. A state change of a portal the player can see SHALL reach them as a live event.

#### Scenario: Doors but no walls
- **WHEN** a room has twenty walls, one of them a closed door outside fog, and a player joins
- **THEN** the player's state holds exactly that door

#### Scenario: Fog lifts off a door
- **WHEN** the GM removes the fog over a door
- **THEN** the player's board shows the door

#### Scenario: Door opened in view
- **WHEN** the GM opens a door the player can see
- **THEN** the player's board shows it open without a full reload

### Requirement: Portal changes are reversible
The GM SHALL be able to undo any portal change from the activity log, which restores the previous kind and state. The undo SHALL be refused when that portal has changed since or its wall is gone.

#### Scenario: Undo an opening
- **WHEN** a player opens a door and the GM undoes that action
- **THEN** the door is closed again

#### Scenario: Changed since
- **WHEN** a door was opened, then locked, and the GM tries to undo the opening
- **THEN** the undo is refused because the door has changed since

### Requirement: Portals on the board
The board SHALL draw every portal the viewer can see, with a style that tells doors from windows and open from closed from locked, and thick enough to find at any zoom. Clicking a portal the viewer may toggle SHALL open it if closed and close it if open. For the GM, Shift-clicking SHALL lock a closed or open portal and unlock a locked one to closed. Plain walls SHALL stay visible to the GM only.

#### Scenario: GM opens a door on the board
- **WHEN** the GM clicks a closed door with the Select tool
- **THEN** the door opens and is drawn as open

#### Scenario: Player clicks a locked door
- **WHEN** a player clicks a locked door
- **THEN** the door stays locked and the player sees "That door is locked."
