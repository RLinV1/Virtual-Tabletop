# Tasks

## 1. Contracts and storage

- [x] 1.1 Add validated shared detection contracts and an ADR; verify shared tests, lint and typecheck.
- [x] 1.2 Persist detection state in Prisma and memory stores with conditional attempts and recovery; verify store race and deletion tests.

## 2. Processing

- [x] 2.1 Build bounded Python/OpenCV detector and at least 24 labeled fixtures; verify at least 90% of positives are within 2 px and negatives never score high confidence.
- [x] 2.2 Add server-owned image reads, BullMQ and in-process dispatch, private service call, startup recovery and error handling; verify worker tests.
- [x] 2.3 Wire both upload paths and GM-only status/retry endpoints; verify map, token, ownership, retry and privacy server tests.

## 3. Editors and deployment

- [x] 3.1 Poll only while library Edit grid or room Adjust grid is open, show status/confidence, and copy suggestions to draft only on Use suggestion; verify UI tests and typecheck.
- [x] 3.2 Add vision to Compose, CI and deployment documentation, reconcile KAN-10 wording, and verify OpenSpec strict validation.
- [x] 3.3 Run lint, typecheck, tests, build and two-browser review covering private preview, dirty drafts, replacement, low confidence and manual play.

## Verification record (2026-09-27)

- Detector fixtures: 20/20 positive maps within 2 px for size and both offsets; 0/8 negative maps high confidence. Node client received the expected 48 px, (11, 17) suggestion from the live Python HTTP service.
- Repository gates: lint, typecheck, full test suite (221 shared, 134 server, 144 web passed), build, and strict OpenSpec validation passed. The 21 database-dependent server tests, including two new detection store contracts, remained skipped without a local Postgres container.
- Two isolated browser contexts (GM and player): low confidence warning, unchanged dirty draft on result arrival, GM-only preview, explicit Apply and Save, map replacement during an old poll, and manual alignment during analysis were reviewed in Chromium.
