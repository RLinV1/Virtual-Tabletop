# Design

## Decisions

1. **One throw state, in the room page.** `RoomPage` holds the table's latest roll and the id of the last roll that landed. A roll is "thrown" while it is newer than that id. The board overlay, the Attack card and the Dice section all read the same `rollThrow`, so they agree on when the total may be shown. On load, the landed id is set to the current latest roll, so joining or reconnecting doesn't replay old rolls. This replaces the Dice section's own landed state.
2. **Where it lands.**
   - A public roll: the board (`BoardDice`), for every viewer.
   - A private roll: the GM's panel tray. The Attack card's tray is used for the GM's own attack while Play is showing, and the Dice section's tray while Dice is showing.
   - A private roll with neither tray in view lands at once. Otherwise it would stay "Rolling…" forever.
3. **Popup after landing.** On landing, the room page sets `popupRollId` for 4 seconds (`ROLL_POPUP_MS`). `rollHeadline` gives the text: `attackHeadline` for attack rolls, otherwise the total and "<roller> · <dice>". The popup is `role="status"`, so screen readers announce it.
4. **Board overlay slot.** `Board` gets an `overlay` prop, drawn above the map and below the toolbar and notices, with `pointer-events: none`, so it never blocks panning, placing or targeting. It is plain DOM over the canvas; no Pixi code changes (CLAUDE.md: Pixi stays in `board/`).
5. **No leak path.** The overlay reads only `state.rolls` from the viewer's filtered snapshot (invariant 3). GM-only rolls are already absent from players' state, and attack parties are already "Unknown" for hidden tokens.

## Risks

- **Two rolls close together:** the second replaces the first mid-throw. That matches how the Dice tray worked before.
- **The GM's private popup appears on their board.** If the GM shares their screen, players could see it there. It carries a GM-only badge, and the dice themselves stay in the panel.
