 * A roll thrown as 3D dice (FR-TAC-09, FR-GM-22), in the room's Dice panel and in the home

 * The roll has already been made when this renders, by the server at the table or by the
 * shared roller on the home page: every die comes to rest on the face that roll chose, and
 * the throw is only how the result is shown arriving. At the table a GM-only roll never
 * reaches a player's state, so it never reaches a player's tray either.
 *
 * Decorative: the text beside it carries the result, so the tray is hidden from assistive
 * technology.
