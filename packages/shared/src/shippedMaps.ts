/**
 * The maps that ship with the app (builtin-library-assets, ADR 0036). Each account's library gets
 * them as rows; the files are served by the web origin from `public/img/`, so keep the URLs stable,
 * since rooms store them. Each grid is measured from the drawn floor tiles so the lines follow the
 * paving and walls (top-down-default-maps). A regenerated map needs measuring again. A map may
 * carry stored walls, in board pixels, that Detect walls offers instead of running detection; they
 * belong to exactly this image, so a regenerated map needs them redone too (FR-GM-09, FR-GM-19).
