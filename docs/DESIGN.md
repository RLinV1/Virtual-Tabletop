   ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

   The App Server and the web client run on the host for development;
   `docker compose up -d --build` also runs them in containers.
   Each service is optional: with DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL or
   S3_ENDPOINT unset the server falls back to in-memory state,
   Postgres-only sequencing, and uploads on local disk (dev only,
   and only when no S3 store answers at 127.0.0.1:8333).
```

`packages/shared` is the contract both sides import: zod schemas, `decide`, `reduce`,
visibility filters, plus pure helpers both sides need (dice, geometry, UVTT parsing, the
activity-log formatter, replay points). Pure TypeScript, no I/O, so the rules are
unit-testable without a network or a browser.

### The one rule

Persistent state changes only along this path:

```
Command → decide() → DomainEvent[] → store.append → reduce() → filter → broadcast
```

`decide` and `reduce` are pure and deterministic; IDs come from `DecideContext.newId`.
Nothing else mutates `RoomState`. Events are append-only; undo (`history.undo`) emits a
compensating event (`ActionUndone`, `MapNukeUndone`, `InitiativeStartUndone`,
`RollDamageUnapplied`), never a delete. Events that replace data carry the old value, which
is what makes undo, the activity log, checkpoints and replay possible.

### The command surface

49 commands produce 47 event types. Grouped by area:

| Area | Commands |
| --- | --- |
| Scene | `scene.setMap`, `scene.setGrid`, `scene.importUVTT` |
| Tokens | `token.create`, `token.duplicate`, `token.move`, `token.setAppearance`, `token.configure`, `token.setImage`, `token.setStats`, `token.setConditions`, `token.setOwners`, `token.setHidden`, `token.delete` |
| Groups | `group.create`, `group.rename`, `group.delete`, `group.assign` |
| Walls and portals | `wall.add`, `wall.update`, `wall.remove`, `wall.clear`, `wall.applyDetected`, `portal.set`, `portal.setState` |
| Fog | `fog.add`, `fog.replace`, `fog.remove` |
| Areas | `template.place`, `template.remove` |
| Turn order | `initiative.start`, `initiative.advance`, `initiative.end` |
| Dice and attacks | `dice.roll`, `roll.rule`, `roll.applyDamage`, `nuke.detonate`, `room.setReducedEffects` |
| Participants | `participant.rename`, `participant.leave`, `participant.revoke`, `participant.resolveDeparture`, `participant.setDiceLook`, `participant.clearDiceLook` |
| Chat | `chat.send` |
| Recovery | `history.undo`, `checkpoint.create`, `checkpoint.restore`, `checkpoint.delete`, `encounter.apply` |

### Two channels, one socket

| Channel | Carries | Persisted | Ordered | Delivery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Committed | Commands in, events out | Yes, with `seq` | Yes | Reliable |
| Ephemeral | `ping`, `tokenDragPreview`, `diceDrop`, `templatePreview` (area aiming) | No | No | `volatile.emit`, dropped under backpressure |

Pointer chatter must never queue ahead of committed state, which is why the ephemeral
channel gets no sequence number and no persistence (FR-SYNC-03). Ephemeral relays still
pass the visibility rules: a GM-only area aim is never relayed to players, and a cleared
aim says whether it was GM-only so players do not learn of it. A latency benchmark
(`npm run test:bench --workspace=@vtt/server`) guards the channel's round-trip time.

The ruler, the Draw tool's lines and shapes, and brush strokes are per-viewer marks that
are never sent anywhere (see §6, FR-TAC-03/04).

### Request paths

| Action | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Sign up / sign in | `POST /api/auth/signup`, `/signin`, `/signout`, `/password`; `GET /api/auth/me` |
| Create a room | `POST /api/rooms` (account required) → `RoomCreated` + `ParticipantJoined`, returns invite code |
| Join by link | `POST /api/invites/:code/join` → `ParticipantJoined`; `GET /api/invites/:code/seat` checks for an existing seat |
| Regenerate invite | `POST /api/rooms/:roomId/invite` (GM only, FR-GM-20) |
| My rooms | `GET /api/gm/rooms`, `GET /api/me/rooms` (joined rooms) |
| Delete a room | `DELETE /api/rooms/:roomId` (ADR 0009) |
| Upload room art | `POST /api/uploads` (GM only, 25 MB, PNG/JPEG/WebP) |
| Library | `/api/library` (maps and token art), `/creatures`, `/encounters`, `/animations`, `/dice`, `/:id/board` (walls and fog prepared on a library map), `/uvtt/imports` |
| UVTT | Import into a room via `scene.importUVTT` or into the library; export a room's scene as `.uvtt` |
| Grid detection | `GET /api/rooms/:roomId/grid-detection`, `POST …/retry` (also per library map) |
| Wall detection | `POST /api/rooms/:roomId/wall-detection`, `GET …/preview`, `GET …/walls` |
| History | `GET /api/rooms/:roomId/history` (activity log), `/replay`, `/replay/:pointId`, `/checkpoints/:id/preview` |
| Connect | Socket.IO handshake carries `{ roomId, guestToken }`; server replies `welcome` with a filtered snapshot |
| Act | `command` → `ack` with a seq, or `rejected` with a code |
| Recover | Client detects a seq gap, sends `resync`, gets a fresh `welcome` |

Every payload containing room data passes through `filterStateForViewer` or
`filterEventForViewer` first — snapshots, events, REST responses (history, replay,
checkpoint preview) and ephemeral relays alike. A seq a viewer may not see arrives as
`redacted`, so their counter advances without leaking the content.

## 2. Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Board renderer | PixiJS v8 | WebGL masks are what keep 100 tokens plus fog at 60 FPS; canvas2d will not. |
| App shell | React + TypeScript | Where the WCAG 2.2 AA target lives, and agents are strong at React, so UI parallelizes across four people. |
| Build | Vite | Instant HMR during canvas work, zero-config production build. |
| Transport | Socket.IO | Rooms map one-to-one onto VTT rooms; reconnection, acks and `volatile.emit` are built in. |
| Server | Node + Express | Sharing the kernel and protocol types with the client removes a whole class of desync bug. |
| Validation | zod | Express validates nothing on its own; zod guards every trust boundary (FR-GM-15). |
| Database | PostgreSQL + Prisma | An append-only event table with snapshots is inherently relational, and migrations stop four people fighting over schema drift. |
| Cache and bus | Redis | Atomic `INCR` gives the per-room seq; BullMQ queues and short-lived wall-job images live here. |
| Object storage | SeaweedFS → S3/R2 | Map images do not belong in Postgres, and SeaweedFS speaks S3 so local dev needs no cloud account. |
| Jobs | BullMQ | Grid and wall detection are async, and BullMQ rides the Redis already required. |
| Map analysis | Python + FastAPI + OpenCV + ONNX Runtime | Grid and wall detection are solved in the Python CV ecosystem; a learned wall model (`models/walls.onnx`) runs beside the rule-based detector. Isolating it matches the boundary FR-GM-11 specifies. |
| Auth | argon2id, opaque session cookies | Memory-hard hashing; server-side sessions store only the token's SHA-256 and revoke instantly. |
| Tests | Vitest + Playwright + Python `unittest` | Vitest shares Vite's transform; Playwright (`npm run test:browser`) drives real browsers through the UVTT flow; the vision service has its own suite. |
| CI | GitHub Actions | Free for the repo, and the whole matrix is one YAML job. |
| Local services | Docker Compose | Everyone runs identical versions of Postgres, Redis, SeaweedFS and the vision service with one command. |
| Hosting | Fly.io or Railway | Both hold persistent WebSocket connections; serverless cannot. |

### Running the backing services

Every stateful dependency runs in Docker, declared in [`../docker-compose.yml`](../docker-compose.yml).
Nobody installs Postgres, Redis or SeaweedFS locally, so a broken environment is fixed by
deleting a volume rather than by debugging one laptop.

| Service | Image | Ports | Volume | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `postgres` | `postgres:17` | 5432 | `pgdata` | Event log, snapshots, accounts, library, memberships |
| `redis` | `redis:7-alpine` | 6379 | `redisdata` | Sequence numbers, BullMQ queues, wall-job images |
| `s3` | `chrislusf/seaweedfs` | 8333 | `s3data` | Uploaded map, token and library images |
| `vision` | `services/vision` | 8000 (loopback) | — | Grid detection over private HTTP |
| `vision-walls` | `services/vision` | — | — | Wall detection worker on the `wall-detection` queue |
| `server` | repo `Dockerfile` | 3001 | — | Applies migrations, then serves API and sockets |
| `web` | repo `Dockerfile` | 5173 | — | Vite dev server |

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis s3 vision vision-walls
npm run prisma:migrate --workspace=@vtt/server

DATABASE_URL=postgres://vtt:vtt@localhost:5432/vtt \
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379 \
S3_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8333 \
npm run dev
```

Credentials are `vtt`/`vtt` and `vtt`/`vttvttvtt` — local development values committed on
purpose. Production refuses to start with the development S3 credentials and must supply
its own. `docker compose down` keeps the data; `down -v` discards it, which is the reset
when a migration goes wrong. The compose `server` sets `SEED_DEV_ACCOUNT=1`, which signs
in as `t@gmail.com` / `password` without sign-up; never set it in production.

**The inner loop runs on the host.** The server and web client run outside Docker for
day-to-day work, because the inner loop wants Vite HMR and `tsx watch`.
`docker compose up -d --build` runs the whole stack, app included, in containers (no hot
reload); see the README's Getting Started.

**Containers are optional, deliberately.** Each service is selected by an environment
variable and the server falls back when one is absent: no `DATABASE_URL` means an in-memory
store, no `S3_ENDPOINT` means the compose SeaweedFS at `127.0.0.1:8333` if it answers and local disk
otherwise (never in production, which refuses to start without it), no `REDIS_URL` means sequencing from
Postgres alone and grid and wall detection reporting themselves unavailable. A fresh checkout
runs with no containers, which is what keeps CI free of a service matrix. Startup states the mode:

```
[vtt] using Postgres event store                    # persistent
[vtt] DATABASE_URL unset — using in-memory store    # lost on every reload
```

In-memory mode loses every room on restart, including the restart `tsx watch` performs on
each save. Any manual test of persistence or reconnection must run against the containers,
and the Postgres store tests skip themselves until `DATABASE_URL` is set.

**Vision.** The vision service lives in `services/vision`, in its own image so the CV
dependency tree stays out of the Node services. Two processes run from it:

- `vision`, the private grid detector (FR-GM-03). The app server's `grid-detection` BullMQ
  worker calls it over the HTTP contract in ADR 0028, stores the result, and the GM reviews
  it in the grid preview (FR-GM-04). See [`GRID-DETECTION.md`](GRID-DETECTION.md).
- `vision-walls`, which consumes the `wall-detection` queue (FR-GM-11, ADR 0029). The app
  server stores the image bytes once in Redis under a content-hash key, enqueues a job
  naming that key, hears completion from BullMQ's queue events, validates the result, and
  tells the room's GM. Detected walls carry a confidence (ADR 0038) and are applied only
  after the GM reviews the preview. See [`WALL-DETECTION.md`](WALL-DETECTION.md).

### Choices we did not make

- **Konva over PixiJS** — friendlier API, but dynamic line of sight needs cheap masking. If LoS is cut, Konva becomes the better call.
- **JWT for sessions** — stateless verification buys nothing with one app server, and opaque tokens revoke instantly.
- **Fastify over Express** — built-in schema validation would serve FR-GM-15 directly. Worth revisiting as the socket surface grows.
- **A CRDT** — rejected. CRDTs converge without a referee; this system *needs* one. Merge-anything semantics contradict authorization and hidden information.

## 3. Repository and CI

npm workspaces, one install from the root.

```
packages/shared    the contract: schemas, decide, reduce, visibility filters, and pure
                   helpers (dice, geometry, uvtt, activityLog, replay, undo). No I/O.
apps/server        Express + Socket.IO.
  domain/            liveRoom.ts is the pipeline; roomRegistry, room lifecycle,
                     grid and wall detection, encounter templates, shipped maps
  http/              REST routes: rooms, library, creatures, encounters, animations, uploads
  identity/          accounts, argon2id passwords, sessions, rate limiting
  membership/        joined-rooms list and seat recovery
  uvtt/              UVTT validation (worker pool), preparation, export
  store/             memory and Postgres room stores, Redis seq, S3 assets, library,
                     identity and membership stores
  ws/socket.ts       the Socket.IO gateway
apps/web           React panels + PixiJS board.
  board/             boardView.ts and everything Pixi: tools, fog, effects, dice throws
  net/               roomConnection.ts is the sync client; REST client and identity
  pages/             home, GM dashboard, library, room, map editor, encounter editor
  panels/            the room's side panels (roster, initiative, dice, attacks, chat, …)
  ui/                shared components
browser/           Playwright specs (UVTT import and export end to end)
services/vision    Python grid detector (FastAPI) and the BullMQ wall-detection worker.
openspec/          change proposals and accepted capability specs
```

```bash
npm install
npm run dev           # server :3001, web :5173 (proxies /api, /socket.io, /uploads)
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test              # shared + server + web vitest suites, then the latency bench
npm run test:browser  # Playwright
npm run build
```

CI runs on every push to `main` and every pull request: install → generate Prisma client →
lint → typecheck → test → vision service tests (grid and wall detection) → build → boot the
server and poll `/health`. The smoke test is the reason the in-memory fallback exists; CI
starts no containers.

Conventions: commands are `noun.verb`, events are `PastTense`, tests and PR titles carry the
FR ID. Changes are planned with OpenSpec (`/opsx:propose`). Schema changes in
`packages/shared` need an ADR and review by the Real-Time Architecture owner.

## 4. The Current Build

The walking skeleton (heartbeat) proved the risky paths — server-authoritative sync,
durable guest identity, and player-safe filtering. The build has since grown to cover
every M1 and M2 requirement in the README and most of M3.

**Working today.**

- *Accounts and rooms.* A GM signs up and creates rooms from the GM dashboard; players join
  by invite link as guests with no account. The GM can regenerate the invite, revoke a
  participant, and delete the room; a room holds at most 32 players. Signed-in users see the
  rooms they have joined, and a lost seat can be recovered.
- *Map preparation.* Upload a map or pick one from the library (built-in maps are seeded as
  library rows). Grid detection runs automatically and the GM corrects it in a preview.
  The map editor walks through grid, walls and fog; wall detection proposes walls with
  confidence for review; walls and portals (doors, windows; open, closed, locked) can be
  drawn and edited by hand. UVTT/dd2vtt files import into a room or the library with
  validation, and a prepared scene exports back to `.uvtt`. Changing the map can move
  existing tokens with it atomically (ADR 0042).
- *Tokens.* Create tokens from scratch or from saved library creatures, place several in a
  row, duplicate to a chosen square, group them, and set image, colour, size, rotation, HP,
  conditions, initiative score and named attacks. Assign owners; players move only their
  own tokens, and walls and closed portals block movement. Hide a token and it never reaches
  player clients.
- *Play.* Pan, zoom, ping, and measure. Manual fog in rectangles or polygons. Shared area
  templates (circles, cones, lines, squares) aimed live on the ephemeral channel, in colours,
  optionally GM-only. Initiative with turn notices. Dice expressions, public or GM-only,
  thrown on the board with 3D dice and per-player dice looks. Attack rolls against one or
  several targets, with GM rulings and damage application, and board animations
  (reducible per room). Room chat with `@` mentions.
- *Recovery.* A human-readable activity log, undo for reversible actions, named checkpoints
  that can be previewed, restored and deleted, and an encounter replay that any participant
  can step through from a checkpoint or the start of an encounter, filtered as themselves.
- *Reuse.* Encounter templates save the map, walls, portals, fog and monster roster, are
  edited in a temporary room, and are applied to a live room in one command. Game presets
  (ADR 0027) set up stats and conditions for a system.
- *Durability.* Reload and come back as the same participant with the same role. Kill the
  server and, with Postgres configured, the room is still there.

**Tests.** About 1,800 automated cases: ~590 unit tests over the pure kernel
(`packages/shared/test`), ~490 server tests including multi-client integration tests over
real sockets and Postgres store tests that run when a database is configured
(`apps/server/test`), ~690 web tests (`apps/web/test`), 33 Python tests for the vision
service, and Playwright browser specs.

**Not built yet.** Dynamic line of sight (FR-GM-19), a shared movement-budget ruler
(FR-TAC-03), and shared drawing overlays (FR-TAC-04). Wall detection does not yet classify
doors and windows.

**Run it — no containers.** A fresh clone plays without Docker, because the store,
sequencer and asset sink each fall back when their environment variable is unset (§2).
Grid and wall detection need Redis and the vision containers, and report themselves
unavailable otherwise.

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>, sign up, create a room, copy the invite link, and open it in a
private window to join as a player. Rooms live in memory and die on every server restart,
including the restart `tsx watch` performs each time you save a file.

**Run it — with persistence.** Needed to exercise the Postgres event store, S3 uploads,
Redis sequencing and detection, and therefore needed for any manual test of restart
survival, reconnection or recovery. Use the commands in §2, or
`docker compose up -d --build` for the whole stack. The startup line tells you which store
you got: `using Postgres event store` or `DATABASE_URL unset — using in-memory store`.

## 5. Data and Identity

### Schema

| Table | Key | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rooms` | `id`, unique `invite_code` | One room; the invite code is the share link |
| `events` | `(room_id, seq)` | Append-only log. The composite key *is* the ordering guarantee (FR-SYNC-04) — a duplicate seq is a constraint violation, not an application bug |
| `snapshots` | `(room_id, seq)` | Periodic state for fast load; derivable, never authoritative |
| `checkpoints` | `id` | Named restore points (FR-REC, ADR 0019) |
| `credentials` | `token_hash` | Guest token → participant, with `revoked_at` (FR-GM-20) |
| `users` | `id` | Accounts: email and argon2id password hash |
| `sessions` | `token_hash` | Sign-ins; only the cookie token's SHA-256 is stored |
| `gm_identities` | `id` | Owners of rooms and library items: one per account, plus legacy GM device identities from before accounts (ADR 0004) |
| `room_members` | — | Which participant a person is in a room; access, not game state, never sent to participants |
| `library_assets` | `id` | Reusable map and token images, with prepared walls and fog for maps (ADR 0037) |
| `library_creatures` | `id` | Saved creatures (ADR 0012, 0020, 0023) |
| `encounter_templates` | `id` | Reusable encounters (ADR 0024) |
| `library_animations` | `id` | Custom attack animations (ADR 0038) |
| `dice_looks` | `id` | Saved dice looks and image skins |
| `asset_refs` | — | Projection of which library assets a room's current state references; derived, never read back into state |
| `room_uploads` | — | Images uploaded inside a room, so room deletion can remove them (ADR 0009) |

Room state is the fold of its events. Snapshots are an optimization and can be deleted
without data loss. Library, account and membership tables are ordinary CRUD data beside the
log, not room state.

### Identity

**Players** are guests. The browser generates an opaque token, keeps it in
`localStorage`, and the server stores only its SHA-256 — so the server never holds a secret
it could leak. Socket.IO replays the handshake `auth` on every automatic reconnect, so a
dropped client rebinds to the same participant with no extra round trip (FR-PL-02,
FR-PL-05). A signed-in player's seat is also recorded in `room_members`, so they can find
their rooms again and recover a seat from another browser.

**GMs** have accounts (FR-GM-01): argon2id password hashes, opaque session cookies stored
hashed, and rate-limited sign-in and join. Creating a room requires an account, as decided
in [`FRONTEND-CONTRACT.md`](FRONTEND-CONTRACT.md) §13.1. Rooms and library items created by
a pre-account GM device identity can be claimed by an account (`/api/gm/legacy/claim`).

`participants` is the identity the game uses. Tokens are owned by participants, not
accounts, so guests are first-class and accounts remain a hosting requirement only.

### Visibility

Hidden information never leaves the server. Both filters in `visibility.ts` are updated
together whenever a new kind of hidden data is added. Today that covers hidden tokens,
tokens under fog that the viewer does not own, fog regions, walls (GM-only), GM-only
portals and areas, GM-only rolls and rulings, checkpoint names, and private metadata.
Authorization is decided in `decide()`; the client's `can.*` helpers are UI hints with no
security value. The GM can "View as player" to check what players see; replays and
checkpoint previews are built through the same filters.

**Why the partials are partial.**
FR-GM-11 detects walls, with confidence, but does not yet classify doors and windows; the
GM reviews every result on its preview before applying it, and adds portals by hand.
FR-GM-18 has portal states that block movement and toggle live, but nothing blocks sight
until line of sight (FR-GM-19) lands.
FR-TAC-03 has a Measure tool that reads distance in grid units, but it is local to the
viewer, uses the fixed 5e diagonal rule (configurable diagonals are KAN-32), and shows no
movement budget.
FR-TAC-04 draws lines, rectangles, circles and strokes, but only on the viewer's own board;
nothing is shared with the table yet.

## 7. Open Decisions

- **Line of sight.** Whether FR-GM-19 ships; if it is cut, revisit Konva (§2). Portal `kind` already distinguishes windows so a closed window can let sight through.
- **Shared rulers and drawings.** FR-TAC-03 would move the ruler onto the ephemeral channel; FR-TAC-04 needs a committed overlay type, a new event, and a decision on whether drawings are undoable.
- **Door and window detection.** Whether `vision-walls` classifies portals or the GM keeps placing them by hand.
- **Legacy GM device identities.** `gm_identities` still holds pre-account device rows; a follow-up removes them and renames the table to `owners`.
- **Duplicate names.** Participant and token names are not unique (KAN-61, KAN-62).
- **Proposed ADRs.** Many ADRs below are implemented but still marked *Proposed* pending Real-Time Architecture review.

### Prior art for map analysis

Wall and portal detection (FR-GM-11) adapts existing MIT-licensed work rather than starting from scratch. Both references implement the same pipeline shape — colour masking → morphological cleanup → contour tracing → segment simplification and endpoint welding — so the approach is well-trodden. Attribution is carried in [`../services/vision/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](../services/vision/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

| Reference | What we take from it | Licence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`ThreeHats/auto-wall`](https://github.com/ThreeHats/auto-wall) — **primary** | Python/OpenCV implementation of the detection pipeline; closest to our service architecture and directly adaptable | MIT |
| [`DimitroffVodka/foundry-auto-wall`](https://github.com/DimitroffVodka/foundry-auto-wall) — secondary | A later derivative of the same project; useful for its centreline tracing mode, which fixes the double-wall artefact thick drawn lines produce | MIT |

Our output target is UVTT wall and portal geometry (FR-GM-06, FR-GM-12), not Foundry `WallDocument`s, so the serialization layer is ours.
