# ADR 0046 — Area effects and group rolls

**Status:** Proposed — awaiting review by the Real-Time Architecture owner · **Amends:** `docs/adr/0039-multi-target-attacks.md` · **Extends:** `docs/adr/0010-attack-roll-context.md`, `docs/adr/0011-attack-rulings.md`, `docs/adr/0013-undo.md`
**Change:** `openspec/changes/area-effects` · **Requirements:** FR-TAC-06, FR-TAC-09, FR-GM-22, FR-GM-23

## Context

A fireball, a trap or a breath weapon catches several tokens at once. Each token rolls the same save, a player rolls the damage, and the GM decides per token whether it takes all of it, half, none, or something else. Today the GM does this one token at a time. `dice.roll` and `roll.applyDamage` name a single target and always apply the full total, and every per-token roll takes one of the 30 slots in the roll log.

ADR 0039 removed an area-of-effect radius from named attacks, in favour of rolling a multi-target attack once per target. That still holds for attacks. An area effect is a different tool: the GM runs it, the outcome is decided per token, and the damage roll is handed to a player.

## Decision

### Group rolls

- `GroupRoll { kind: "group", id, expression, label, byParticipantId, visibility, entries[] }` has one entry per token: `{ tokenId, name, hidden, dice, total }`. As with `AttackSide`, `name` and `hidden` are recorded at roll time, so the log still reads right after a rename or delete, and a token once concealed stays concealed for good.
- `RoomState.rolls` becomes `(DiceRoll | GroupRoll)[]`. A group roll takes one log slot and is ordered and capped with every other roll.
  - `DiceRoll` is unchanged and has no `kind`, so stored rolls and events parse as before.
  - Code that reads `.attack`, `.dice` and similar narrows first with `isGroupRoll`. `diceRollsOf` lists only the plain rolls.
- Command `dice.rollGroup { tokenIds (1–30, distinct), expression, label?, visibility }`, GM only. Event `GroupRolled { roll }`.
  - `group.*` is already used by token groups (ADR 0026), so the command sits under `dice.*`.
  - `decide` rolls the expression once per token with `ctx.random`.

### Area effects

- `RoomState.areaEffect: AreaEffect | null`. A room holds at most one. A snapshot from before this change has no such field, and readers treat it as `null`.

  ```
  AreaEffect {
    id, label, expression, byParticipantId,
    targets: { tokenId, name, hidden, roll: { dice, total } | null }[],
    call:   { participantId } | null,
    damage: { mode: "single", expression, byParticipantId, dice, total }
          | { mode: "perTarget", expression, byParticipantId, results: { tokenId, dice, total }[] }
          | null,
  }
  ```

- The stage is derived from the data, never stored:
  - `damage` set → **rolled**;
  - otherwise `call` set → **called**;
  - otherwise **started**.
- The effect keeps its own saves and its own damage roll and adds nothing to `rolls`. The saves are always GM-only, and keeping them out of the log means they can't drop out of the 30-roll window while the effect is still open.
- Commands, all GM-only except `rollDamage`:

  | Command | Event | Rule |
  |---|---|---|
  | `areaEffect.start { tokenIds, expression, label? }` | `AreaEffectStarted { effect }` | Needs the preset's attacks feature. Refused while another effect is open. |
  | `areaEffect.call { effectId, participantId }` | `AreaEffectCalled { effectId, participantId, previous }` | One command covers the first call (`previous: null`), a reassignment and a takeover (the GM calling themselves). Refused once the damage is rolled, or when the call already sits with that participant. |
  | `areaEffect.rollDamage { effectId, expression, mode }` | `AreaEffectDamageRolled { effectId, damage }` | Only the participant holding a pending call may send it. With `perTarget`, the same expression is rolled once for each target that still exists. |
  | `areaEffect.resolve { effectId, rows[] }` | `TokenStatsSet`…, `TokenConditionsSet`…, `AreaEffectResolved { effect, amounts }` | Refused while a call is pending. |
  | `areaEffect.close { effectId }` | `AreaEffectClosed { effect }` | Changes no token. |

- Each resolve row is `{ tokenId, amount: int | null, addConditions }`.
  - **Computed on the client:** Half, None and "conditions for all" are merged into the rows in the UI.
  - **Computed by `decide`, from the token's state at that moment:** the new HP (floored at `MIN_HP`; healing is capped at `maxHp` and never lowers HP), and the condition set (the existing conditions plus the added ones, at most 12).
  - **Closing the effect** is why a second Confirm from a stale screen is refused.
- `AreaEffectResolved` and `AreaEffectClosed` carry the whole effect they close (invariant 6).

### Undo

`AreaEffectResolved` is reversible and its inverse is empty. Undoing a resolve emits the inverse `TokenStatsSet` and `TokenConditionsSet` events and then `ActionUndone`. The existing per-token conflict checks refuse the undo once any of those values has changed. `canUndo` accepts a stats change together with `AreaEffectResolved`, as it already does with `RollDamageApplied` and `MapNuked`.

Undo does not reopen the effect, for two reasons:
- another effect may have opened since, and only one can be open;
- an HP rollback should not bring a damage prompt back to a player.

### Visibility (FR-GM-22, FR-GM-23)

- **Group roll.** A GM-only group roll never reaches a player. A public one reaches players with the entries for concealed tokens removed: hidden tokens, unowned tokens under fog, and entries marked `hidden`. Entries are removed rather than shown as "Unknown", so the number of entries reveals nothing. A roll with no visible entries is withheld entirely.
- **Area effect.** One projection, `areaEffectForViewer`, is used by both `filterStateForViewer` and `filterEventForViewer`:
  - every target's save becomes `null`;
  - concealed targets, and their per-target damage results, are removed;
  - `call`, `label` and the single damage total pass through.
- **Area effect events.** The filter returns a rewritten copy of each event:
  - `AreaEffectStarted`, `AreaEffectDamageRolled` and `AreaEffectClosed` are projected;
  - `AreaEffectResolved` is projected with `amounts` kept only for the targets the player can see, so their board can show damage numbers. Those targets' HP changes already reach the player, so this reveals nothing new;
  - `AreaEffectCalled` passes unchanged, since it names only participants, who are public.
- **Withheld effects.** If a player can see none of an effect's targets and doesn't hold its call, the effect is withheld from them entirely: `areaEffect: null` in the snapshot, and its events are redacted. An empty target list would otherwise tell them a concealed token is being targeted.
  - A call that gives a withheld effect to a player, or moves it away from them, is answered with a resync, as is any change that conceals or reveals a target.
  - A player who is called for an all-hidden effect learns only that it exists, its label, and that it has no target they can see.
- **The HP and condition changes** inside a resolve keep their existing per-token redaction.
- **Replay.** Table frames also carry the viewer's copy of the open area effect.

## Consequences

- This adds new state, commands and events. No existing command or event changes meaning.
- Every reader of `rolls` narrows on `isGroupRoll`, and the compiler finds each one.
- An open effect counts as one pending ruling in the GM's Rulings list, Play tab badge and initiative reminder (`attack-rulings`).
- This leaves out players making group rolls, rolling their own saves, a DC with automatic outcomes, and several open effects at once.
