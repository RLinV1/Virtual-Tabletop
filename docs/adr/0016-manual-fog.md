# ADR 0016 — Manual fog of war

**Status:** Accepted — reviewed by the Real-Time Architecture owner (Raymond), 2026-10-03 · **Extends:** `docs/adr/0001-event-model.md`, `docs/adr/0003-tactical-state.md`, `docs/adr/0007-shared-area-templates.md`, `docs/adr/0013-undo.md`
**Change:** `openspec/changes/kan-28-manual-fog` · **Ticket:** KAN-28 (FR-GM-17)

## Context

FR-GM-17 asks for manual fog of war: the GM conceals rectangular or polygonal regions, players see them masked, the GM sees them semi-transparent, content under fog is not sent to players, and fog changes are undoable so an accidental reveal can be taken back. KAN-28 stresses that the third criterion is a visibility invariant (invariant 3), not a rendering detail. Masking in Pixi alone would ship the hidden tokens to every browser.

## Decision

Fog regions become room state, following the standard pattern.

- **State.** `RoomState.fog: Record<Id, FogRegion>`, where `FogRegion` is `{ id, shape: "rect" | "polygon", points: Point[3..64] }` in board coordinates (invariant 8). A rectangle is stored as its four corners, so every reader handles one geometry. A room holds at most `MAX_FOG_REGIONS` (100).
- **Commands** (GM only, `forbidden` otherwise; both strict):
  - `fog.add { region: { shape: "rect", from, to } | { shape: "polygon", points } }`. `decide` normalises a rectangle into four corners and rejects a region with no area as `invalid`.
  - `fog.remove { regionId }`.
- **Events.**
  - `FogAdded { region }`.
  - `FogRemoved { region }`, carrying the whole region (invariant 6).
- **Visibility (invariant 3).** One function, `concealedFrom(fog, token, viewer)`, decides whether a player may see a token: it is hidden, or its centre is inside a fog region and the viewer does not own it. The GM sees everything.
  - `filterStateForViewer` keeps only tokens not concealed from the viewer, so the turn order and attack sides (derived from that token map) follow. A template is withheld when it is GM-only, or when its origin is under fog and the viewer did not place it. Fog regions are sent to players: they are the mask, and they name no token.
  - `filterEventForViewer`: `FogAdded` / `FogRemoved` resync players. `TokenMoved` and `TokenOwnersSet` compare concealment before and after: unchanged and visible passes, unchanged and concealed is redacted, changed resyncs. `TokenCreated`, `TokenDeleted` and other token events are redacted when concealed. Template events are redacted when concealed under the fog before the event; fog changes only through events that resync, so that is the fog the player's state reflects.
  - `LiveRoom.relayEphemeral` drops a drag preview for a viewer from whom the token is concealed, or for whom its preview point is under fog.
- **Attack rolls.** An unowned token under fog is marked `hidden` on every attack roll that names it: at roll time in `decide`, and in `reduce` when fog is added over it or it moves into fog. Like a hidden token (ADR 0010), its side then stays blank for players after a delete, reveal or rename. Party tokens (with owners) follow their current visibility instead, so the party's own names don't vanish from old rolls each time they walk through fog.
- **Rejections.** Commands from a player about a fogged token, or another player's template under fog, answer `not_found`, as for a hidden token.
- **Ordering.** `token.configure` and `token.setAppearance` emit a move into fog before any other edit, and a move out of fog after them, the same "hide first, reveal last" rule as `TokenHiddenSet`.
- **`InitiativeEnded`** passes to players with `previous` reduced to the tokens they may see.
- **Pings.** The GM's automatic attack ping is skipped for a fogged target.
- **Owners keep their tokens.** A player whose token is under fog still sees and moves it. The board draws fog between the grid and the tokens, so it stays on top of the mask.
- **Undo.** `FogAdded` and `FogRemoved` join `REVERSIBLE_EVENT_TYPES` as each other's inverse. Undoing an add is refused once the region is gone; undoing a removal is refused if the region is back, or if the room is already at `MAX_FOG_REGIONS`.
- **Activity log.** "GM added a fog rectangle", "GM removed a fog polygon".
- **Keyboard path (WCAG 2.1.1).** The board's Fog tool needs a pointer, so the GM panel has a Fog of war section that fogs the whole map, fogs a block of grid cells by column and row, and lists every region by the cells it covers with a Reveal button. It is web-only and sends the same `fog.add` / `fog.remove` commands, so the contract above is unchanged.

`fog.add` / `fog.remove` are new commands and `FogAdded` / `FogRemoved` new events. No existing schema changes shape. `RoomState` gains a field that `emptyRoomState` initializes, and state is rebuilt by replaying events, so existing rooms load with `fog: {}`. The filters change behaviour for tokens and templates under fog, which only exist once fog does.

## Consequences

- **Backward compatible.** Old event logs replay unchanged; no migration.
- **Clients.** A client built before this change would throw on the new events. Accepted for a coordinated web + server deploy, as with every earlier event addition.
- **Snapshots on fog changes.** Every fog change resyncs each player. Fog changes are rare GM actions.
- **Centre-point rule.** A large token whose centre is outside fog stays visible even if part of it is under fog.
- **Map pixels are not protected.** The map image URL is already delivered; fog is visual concealment of the picture (FRONTEND-CONTRACT.md, visibility contract). Use maps without baked-in secrets.
- **Map changes keep fog.** Regions stay in board coordinates when the map is replaced; the GM removes them by hand. Scene replacement (FRONTEND-CONTRACT.md) is the place to reset them.
- **Not covered here.** Dynamic line of sight, walls and portals (FR-GM-18, FR-GM-19); editing a placed region; brush-painted fog.

## Alternatives considered

- **Mask-only fog in Pixi.** Rejected: hidden tokens would still be in the player's state and socket frames (DESIGN.md §9).
- **Server-derived visible-area polygon sent instead of the fog regions.** Deferred: with only manual fog, the fogged polygons are an equivalent safe projection, and computing a complement adds geometry work for no secrecy gain. Line of sight (FR-GM-19) is the natural place to introduce it.
- **A fog bitmap or painted grid.** Rejected: large state, poor fit for an append-only log, and it does not follow a grid change.
- **Hide owned tokens under fog too.** Rejected: a player would lose sight of their own character the moment the GM fogs the room it stands in.
