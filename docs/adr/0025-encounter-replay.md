# ADR 0025: Encounter replay

**Status:** Proposed — awaiting review by the Real-Time Architecture owner (Raymond)
**Owner:** Real-Time Architecture (Raymond) · **Changes:** `openspec/changes/kan-51-encounter-replay` · **Ticket:** KAN-51 (FR-PL-07)

## Context

FR-PL-07 asks for a replay of the action log from a chosen checkpoint, so a late-arriving player can catch up. The activity log (FR-REC-01) already walks the log with the visibility filters, but it is GM-only by design: `activityHistory` says historical visibility "needs a separate disclosure policy". This ADR is that policy for replay. Checkpoints are GM-only (ADR 0019): players never receive their ids or names.

## Decision

### What a participant may replay

Any active participant may replay the room's history **as themselves**: every step passes through `filterEventForViewer` and `filterStateForViewer` with that participant as the viewer, exactly as live sync would have delivered it. A replay therefore shows nothing the participant would not have seen had they watched from the start. Steps the viewer could not see (`redacted`) are left out entirely, not shown as gaps.

### Replay points

`replayPoints(events, viewer)` derives points from the log: the room's start (`start`), the moment before each `InitiativeStarted` (`e<seq>`), and each `CheckpointCreated` (`c<n>`). Point ids never contain a checkpoint id. The GM sees checkpoint names; players see "Checkpoint 1", "Checkpoint 2" …. A player thereby learns that the GM saved a checkpoint and when. They already learn that *an* event happened at that seq (it is redacted, not hidden), so this discloses only the kind of event, which carries no table content.

### Frames

The server folds the log to the point and returns the filtered start state, then one frame per visible change:

- `event`: the filtered committed event (no `commandId` for players), folded on the client with `reduceReceived`, as live sync does.
- `table`: for a change live sync answers with a resync, the filtered `TableState` and dice log after it. A resync only ever changes table content and rolls; participants and chat change only through events that pass as-is. Sending the table, not a full snapshot, keeps a turn-by-turn replay small.

Each frame carries a sentence: `formatActivity` on the filtered event and filtered prior state for `event` frames, and a neutral sentence that names only the (public) actor and the kind of change for `table` frames.

### Transport and limits

Two read-only REST endpoints, authenticated with the room's bearer credential like the history route: `GET /api/rooms/:roomId/replay` (points) and `GET /api/rooms/:roomId/replay/:pointId` (frames). Only ids in the viewer's own point list are accepted. A replay carries at most 2,000 frames and says when it was cut short. Building one folds the whole log, the same cost as a checkpoint restore; a build over 500 ms is logged.

### Client

The replayed state replaces the shown state the way "View as player" does: board, panels and chat read-only through a refusing connection that also drops ephemeral messages. The live room keeps updating underneath.

## Consequences

- No new command, event or state; nothing is persisted by replaying (invariants 1 and 4 untouched).
- Any future hidden data is protected in replay automatically once it is handled in the two filters (invariant 3).
- A test (`packages/shared/test/replay.test.ts`) checks that the client's fold equals `filterStateForViewer` of the true state at every step, so a filter change that breaks replay is caught.

## Alternatives considered

- **Send raw events and filter on the client.** The client would hold hidden data.
- **Send a filtered snapshot per step.** Simple, but initiative advances resync every turn; a long replay would be megabytes.
- **Reuse `state.checkpoints` for points.** Would expose checkpoint ids and lose checkpoints past the 50-entry cap.
- **Socket messages instead of REST.** A replay is a one-off read with no ordering relationship to the live stream.
